# molecularDynamicsJulia

## What
This repository contains Julia scripts I wrote for running and processing replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) runs in 2014. Before this, everything was written in Bash (some of which I've also uploaded).
 
## Why
I wrote these scripts because I thought (and still do think) Julia is a cool language, and because some of them were ~10x faster than the Bash equivalent.

## Documentation
I'll probably add some documentation, but please be aware that these scripts were written when:
 - I barely knew how to program
 - Julia was young(er), compatible with version ~0.2-0.3.
